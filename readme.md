# Uvc_dev
## What is this ?
This is a standalone homebrew containing test code for the [UVC branch of SysDVR](https://github.com/exelix11/SysDVR/tree/UVC). \
It was meant to implement a usb video class device via software for streaming gampeplay with SysDVR. I'm not interested on working on this animore and it's here only for referece.

This isn't in a functional state, only thing completed is the UVC descriptor and a little more, most OSes should detect the switch as a usb camera but the protocol is not implemented at all.
